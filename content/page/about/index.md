I am a cybersecurity enthusiast, primarily interested in web and hardware. I enjoy developing open source projects, treating it as a fun activity. In my free time, I mainly ride my skateboard and read booksâ€¦

I'm trying to regularly upload videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@qrxnz9209">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://odysee.com/@qrxnz:6?r=6t7UjNAVVT5zLF9LhSrzZZ479VWpVXrE">Odysee</a>
