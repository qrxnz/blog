## About Me
I am a cybersecurity enthusiast, primarily interested in web and hardware. I enjoy developing open source projects, treating it as a fun activity. In my free time, I mainly ride my skateboard and read books…

I'm trying to regularly upload videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@qrxnz9209) and [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@qrxnz:6?r=6t7UjNAVVT5zLF9LhSrzZZ479VWpVXrE)
